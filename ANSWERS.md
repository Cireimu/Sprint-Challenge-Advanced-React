    Unlike function components class components are able to implement logic and state as well as use the React lifecycle

- [ ] Name three lifecycle methods and their purposes.

    1. componentDidMount - used to load data from a remote endpoint
    2. componentDidUpdate - used to make changes to the DOM when the component is updated.
    3. componentWillUnmount - invoked at the end of a component's lifecycle to perform any necessarry "clean up"

- [ ] What is the purpose of a custom hook?

    the purpose of a custom hook is to allow you to apply a non-visual behaviour and stateful logic that is to be used repeatedly 

- [ ] Why is it important to test our apps?

    It's important to unit test so that we save much more time due to not having to manual test and allows us to over all test and find out bugs much faster and easier.
